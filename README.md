# Emagi Backend

### Introduction

Today we're going to make the back end for an app that can convert words to emojis, search for emojis, and give you a random emoji. It's gonna be ðŸ”¥.


### Workflow

For each test, you'll have to:

1. Create a file with the name from the test. For `emagify.test.js`, your file is going to be called `emagify.js`, and so on.
2. Uncomment the test file's `require` line for that file. This gives that file access to your file!
3. After you've written a function (or even just the skeleton for one), you should add a `module.exports = ` and the name of the function (but without parentheses!) at the bottom of the file. This gives the test file something to import!
4. You will likely have to grab `symbols` and `words` from their files in the same way. Get used to `require` and `module.exports`  for importing and exporting between files!


### Methods Worth Looking Into To Help With These Tasks

* Array's `.includes`
* String's `.includes`
* Array's `.indexOf`
* Math's `.floor` and `.random`
